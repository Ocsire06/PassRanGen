# PassRanGen (PRG)
A super secure password generator with a flexible length and CUI interface.

PassRanGen (or simply PRG) is a program which allows you to create secure passwords by the help of your
input.

PRG is an OPEN-SOURCE project, means I only own the trademark and name and everything else is transparent to
the community. You are free to edit the project any way, shape or form possible and you can distribute it 
however you prefer.

Read `readme.txt` for more information.
