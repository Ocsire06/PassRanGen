PassRanGen (or simply PRG) is a program which allows you to create secure passwords by the help of your
input.

PRG is an OPEN-SOURCE project, means I only own the trademark and name and everything else is transparent to
the community. You are free to edit the project any way, shape or form possible and you can distribute it 
however you prefer.

A credit is not mandatory, but appreciated. :)

Category- Open Source & FOSS
Owner- Bedanta Dey / Ocsire

Use PRG to randomize passwords and use them wherever you want! Make sure to remember them though <3
Please do not enter comically large numbers like 123123 or 6942091121 when asked for password length.
